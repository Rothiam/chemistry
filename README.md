# README

This app takes in a chemical equation, given by the user through a friendly interface, and then displays information such as the amount of energy in the reactants, the amount of energy in the products, and the enthalpy after the reaction.

This is the developmental version. The live version can be found at calhoun-chemistry.herokuapp.com

I began working on this for school, but then continued to update it. I recently squashed the first 13 commits into one initial commit. A backup of this inital commit can be found in my Chemistry-2 repo.
